### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Crowd Movement Simulation Software

This Python-based software is designed to simulate **crowd movement** in various environments, providing a comprehensive tool for researchers, architects, and engineers to model and study crowd behavior. Key features include:

- 🎨 **Graphical editor** to create and modify custom buildings with walls, doors, and staircases. Each building element can be assigned specific properties, such as width, bounciness, or color.
- 🧑 **Customizable individuals** with attributes like **height, weight, speed**, as well as their **personality and behavior** in the crowd, allowing for diverse and realistic simulations.
- 🚪 **Editable exit points** such as doors and staircases, enabling users to experiment with different evacuation strategies and crowd flow scenarios.
- 🔥 **Environmental hazards** like **fires** can be added to the simulation to observe crowd responses in emergency situations.
- 🧮 **Crowd movement algorithm** calculates the flow of individuals through the environment over a selected time period, simulating real-world crowd dynamics.
- 🎥 **Playback feature** to review the simulation as a video, enabling detailed analysis of crowd behavior and movement patterns.

This tool provides a powerful way to model crowd dynamics and experiment with different scenarios, improving safety and efficiency in building designs or emergency protocols.
